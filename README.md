# Programming language classification with Random Forest
 Script to determine the programming language based on a code snippet. Code snippets dataset is downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/amalhasni/creating-labeled-code-snippets-dataset). The code execution is rather slow but very successful based on WordClouds that provided weights of each word for each code snippet.
